# a list of somewhat cg/cs related, not-so-technical books that I enjoy


### A Biography of the Pixel
> I love it when computer scientist quotes T. S. Eliot.

### Plastic Reality: Special Effects, Technology, and the Emergence of 1970s Blockbuster Aesthetics
> I checked it out after Prof. Theodore Kim introduced in on his Twitter. Last year I had some discussions with my professors on the style of computer graphics and computer animatioms, and I guess I was interested in visual effects study even before I heard the name "visual effects study". I have been meaning to explore how graphics algorithms impact films and animations in return, and this gave me an opportunity to get started.
      
### The Empire of Effects: Industrial Light and Magic and the Rendering of Realism
> A new book by Prof. Julie Turnock. It's gonna come out later this summer, hopefully I'll finish reading Plastic Reaslity by then.

### Nabokov's Favorite Word Is Mauve
> And Nabokov is my favorite writer.
      
### The Practice of Light
> Rendering, like Rembrandt, is a matter of lights and shadows.
