# a list of somewhat cg/cs related, not-so-technical books that I enjoy


### A Biography of the Pixel
> I love it when computer scientist quotes T. S. Eliot.

### Plastic Reality: Special Effects, Technology, and the Emergence of 1970s Blockbuster Aesthetics
> I checked it out after Prof. Theodore Kim introduced in on his Twitter. Last year I had some discussions with my professors on the style of computer graphics and computer animatioms, and I guess I was interested in visual effects study even before I heard the name "visual effects study". I have been meaning to explore how graphics algorithms impact films and animations in return, and this gave me a nice opportunity to get started.
      
### The Empire of Effects: Industrial Light and Magic and the Rendering of Realism
> A new book by Prof. Julie Turnock. It's gonna come out later this summer, hopefully I'll finish reading Plastic Reaslity by then. I am so exicted to read this book, and I hope it could inspire some interesting research questions in computer graphics and HCI.

### The Practice of Light
> Rendering is like Rembrandt. 

### Nabokov's Favorite Word Is Mauve
> And Nabokov is my favorite writer. Great read to grasp a sense of what digital humanities is about, but too bad the author discuss too little Nabokov!

### Close Reading with Computers: Textual Scholarship, Computational Formalism, and David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas
> I am starting to feel like my literary taste has been approved by digital humanity scholars :-) 
> However, as I am not a humanities scholar, this book is a bit too formal and difficult for me, and I am not sure how much of this book I will be able to understand and absorb.

## The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art
